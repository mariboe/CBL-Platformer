# CBL-Platformer

A platformer game for CBL.

Open the folder CBL-PLATFORMER in any IDE. 

To run the game you just run the file MainFrame.java in the folder CBL_menu, although your IDE should already have recognised this. 

To pause and exit the game you will have to be in a game first.

to move to the left (<--) = a.
to move to the right (-->) = d.
jump = space bar.
hang on a ceiling (spiderman mode) = hold the space bar when touching something with your head.
pause the game = esc.
exit the game = e.
